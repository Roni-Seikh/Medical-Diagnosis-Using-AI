## Description
This application provides an easy-to-use interface for predicting medical conditions. It uses various machine learning models that have been trained on relevant datasets to make accurate predictions. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals with quicker diagnostic processes.

### **Key Features:**
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Identifies the risk of heart disease.
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction**: Detects early-stage Parkinson's disease.
- **Lung Cancer Prediction**: Assists in predicting lung cancer risk.
- **Thyroid Prediction**: Predicts thyroid conditions using medical inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the development.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for model training.
- **Flask/Streamlit**: Web framework used for deploying the application.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Joblib**: Model serialization.

## Models
The following models have been developed and saved as `.sav` files:
- **Diabetes Model**: `diabetes_model.sav`
- **Heart Disease Model**: `heart_disease_model.sav`
- **Parkinson's Disease Model**: `parkinsons_model.sav`
- **Lung Disease Model**: `lungs_disease_model.sav`
- **Thyroid Model**: `thyroid_model.sav`

These models use historical medical data to predict the likelihood of the disease based on user input.

## Setup
### Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Git for version control.
